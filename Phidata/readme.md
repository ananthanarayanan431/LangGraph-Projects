# Multi-Agent Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Application

This project implements a multi-agent RAG application utilizing the Phidata framework, Pinecone's vector database, and LangChain's knowledge base.

## Overview

The application leverages Phidata to build multi-modal agents with memory, knowledge, tools, and reasoning capabilities. These agents collaborate to process and analyze data, providing actionable insights and financial planning based on companies' annual reports.

## Features

- **Multi-Agent Orchestration**: Agents work together to perform complex tasks.
- **Integration with Pinecone**: Utilizes Pinecone's vector database for efficient data retrieval.
- **LangChain Knowledge Base**: Incorporates LangChain for enhanced knowledge management.
- **Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Built-in RAG capabilities for improved information synthesis.
- **Structured Outputs**: Agents return outputs in structured formats for easy interpretation.
- **Reasoning and Tool Usage**: Agents can reason and utilize tools like web search and financial data retrieval.
